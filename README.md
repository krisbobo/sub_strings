# Implement a method `#substrings` that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found

## Note: Ensure that the method is case insensitive, meaning 'hand' will match 'Hand' and 'HAND', and can handle multiple words
